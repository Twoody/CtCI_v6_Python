Example1:
	You have two ropes, and each takes exactly one hour to burn.
	How would you use them to time exactly 15 minutes?
	Note that the ropes are of uneven desities, so half the rope length
	wise does not necessarily take half an hour to burn.
	Tip:
		Stop here and spend some time trying to sholve thie problem on your
		own. IF you absolutely must, read through this section for hints,
		but do so slowly.

We know two facts:
	Fact 1: We can time an hour with either piece of rope.
	Fact 2: We can time two hours with both pieces of rope.

Now, start thinking about what it means to be a rope, what it means to be
existant with this problem, and what real world variables we can apply.

BE CREATIVE!

For example, what is stopping us from lighting multiple fires?
If we light more than one fire, (the rope at both ends), we can caclutate
30 minutes!

Fact 3: We can start multiple fires at the same time.
Fact 4: We can calculate 30 minutes (or rather x/2)

And, if we start rope2 at the same time we start rope1 (implying three fires
are all started at the same time), we can then light the last end of rope2
at the point rope1 has finished burning.

Fact 5: (Found by asking "Can we repeat fact4 and fact3)
	We can compount fact 4 and solve for 60/2/2 --> 15!

This implication means we now are burning rope2 at twice the speed.
And rope2 only has 30minutes left, as we timed it with rope1.
Thus, in 15 minutes, rope2 will be fully burnt out.
