Example2: The Nine Balls Questions
	You have nine balls. Eight are of the same weight, and one is 
	heavier. You are given a balance which tells you only whether the
	left side of the right side is heaveier.
	Find the heavy ball in just two uses of the scale.

Fact 1: There are nine balls:
Fact 2: Eight balls way the same length.
Fact 3: One ball ball ways more than the other 8
Fact 4: There exists a blance.
Fact 5: The scale tells you which side is heavier.

Even though we want to get down to two uses eventually,
what would a normal brute force routine look like?
	We would take 4 balls, put them on one side, and put the other 4
	balls on the other side.
	If they are the same weight, then cycle in the ninth, unused ball.
	A cycle would looke like:
		1 2 3 4 | 5 6 7 8 | 9
		9 1 2 3 | 4 5 6 7 | 8
		8 9 1 2 | 3 4 5 6 | 7
		...
		2 3 4 5 || 6 7 8 9 | 1

But do we need to go through all of these iterations?
Doesn't our problem only have two variables we are checking:
weight1 and weight2?
If so, we can take our above example, and build cases on where
our heavier weight might be. It only has three spots available, 
making this test case easy to draw out:
     x x x x | x x x x | y
	  y x x x | x x x x | x   --> Found heavier ball

	  x x x y | x x x x | x   --> Know where heavier ball is

	  x x x x | x x x y | x   --> know where heavier ball is

Fact 6: If the weights are a match, our odd ball is the heavy ball.

Now, we can build onto our `x` and `y` example where we do not know
the weights yet.
If we repeat this "split them up" appraoch, we will have two of the
same variations of both initial cases where we only know what set y is in.

    x x | x y  --> we know what side y is on, but not which one is y.
	 x y | x x  --> we know what side y is on, but not which one is y.

Thus, with this first approach, we see that we will need a third attempt
to find where `y` is.

We still have our rules:
	Fact 1: There are nine balls:
	Fact 2: Eight balls way the same length.
	Fact 3: One ball ball ways more than the other 8
	Fact 4: There exists a blance.
	Fact 5: The scale tells you which side is heavier.
	Fact 6: If the weights are a match, our odd ball is the heavy ball.
	Fact 7: It is possible to solve the puzzle in 3 attempts

The few variables we can control is how many balls we can put on the
scale initially. We also can think of our end case more logically now.
WE HAVE TO USE OUR SECOND ATTEMPT TO DECIPHER BETWEEN ONLY 3< BALLS.
That is, our last attempt has to look something like:
	x | x | y
or
	x | y

Then, this means in our first attempt, we have to successfully remove
6 or 7 balls from our list.
If we split the balls into groups of 3, what then?
  x x x | x y x || x x x  --> We know where heavy bal is 
  x x y | x x x || x x x  --> We know where heavy ball is
  x x x | x x x || x x y  --> We know where heavy ball is

TADA! We thus found our group of three, and can now go with our final step.
