Before spending time on this chapter, review your companies policy
on what questions are viable for the interview, and which are not.
Be aware that with some companies who use employees to interview,
such that the employees can pick their own interview questions.
Sometimes, these individuals will bend the rules, and it is
important to keep that in mind!

Prime numbers:
	A prime number is a number only divisible by one and itself.
	When coding, remember our math, and how we only need to iterate up
	to sqrrt(n) where n is the number to be verified as prime or not.

Probability
	Venn Diagrams, Unions, Intersections, Finding the opposite (i.e. if
	probability of event A is 33%, then event B is probability 77%), 
	Independence, Mutual Exclusivity (which makes `Finding the opposite`
	work), 

Problem Tackling Approach
	1. Start Talking
	2. Develop rules and laws the problem must abide by
		A. Ratios
		B. Base Cases
		C. Induction

Example1:
	You have two ropes, and each takes exactly one hour to burn.
	How would you use them to time exactly 15 minutes?
	Note that the ropes are of uneven desities, so half the rope length
	wise does not necessarily take half an hour to burn.
	Tip:
		Stop here and spend some time trying to sholve thie problem on your
		own. IF you absolutely must, read through this section for hints,
		but do so slowly.

Worst Case Shifting
	Many brainteasers are worst-case minimization problems, worded either
	in terms of minimizing an action or in doing something at most a 
	specific number of times.
	A Useful technique is to try to `balance` the worse case.
	That is, if an early decision results ina skewing of the worst case,
	we can sometimes change the decision to balance out the worst-case.
	For Example (Example2):
		The Nine Balls Questions
		You have nine balls. Eight are of the same weight, and one is 
		heavier. You are given a balance which tells you only whether the
		left side of the right side is heaveier.
		Find the heavy ball in just two uses of the scale.

Algorithm Approaches:
	If you get stuck, remember that these are all typically just
	algorithms that have fancy words and techincal aspects removed.
	Look for a base case, BUILD, and DIY.
	Just try and keep talking

10.	Poison
	You have 1000 jugs of water. 1 is poisoned.
	You have 10 test strips, which can be used to detect poison.
	A single drop of poison will turn the test strip positive permanently.
	You can put any number of drops on a test strip at once, and you can 
	reuse a test strip as many times as youd like.
	However, you can only run tests once per day, and it takes seven days
	to return a result. How would you figure out the poisoned bottle in as 
	few dats as possible?
