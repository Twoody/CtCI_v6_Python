	5. Sum Lists
			Given two numbers represented by a linked list, where each
			node contains a single digig, write a function that adds the
			two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
			The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's
			digit is at the head of the list.
			Example:
				Input: (7-> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2).
					That is, 617 + 295.
				Output: 2 -> 1 -> 9.
					That is, 912.
			FOLLOW UP:
				Suppose the digits are stored in forward order. 
				Repeat the above problem.
				EXAMPLE
					Input: (6 -> 1 -> 7) + (2 -> 9 -> 5).
						That is,617 + 295. 
					Output: 9 -> 1 -> 2.
						That is, 912.
			Hints: 
				#7, #30, #71, #95, #109
