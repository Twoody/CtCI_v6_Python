'''
	4. Partition
			Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such 
			that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than 
			or equal to x. IF x is contained within the list, the values 
			of x only need to be after the elements less than x. The 
			partition element x can appear anywhere in the `right partition`; 
			It does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.
			Example:
				I:  3-> 5-> 8-> 5 ->10-> 2-> 1
				O:  3-> 1-> 2-> 10-> 5-> 5-> 8
