	3. Delete Middle Node
			Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a
			singly linked list, given only access to that node.
			The middle is any node but the first and last node, not 
			necessarily the exact middle. 
			Example:
				I: the node c from the linked list:
					a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> f
				O: Nothing is retured. The new linked list looks like:
					a -> b -> d -> e -> f

			not allowed?
