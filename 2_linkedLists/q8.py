			Given a circular libked list, implement an algorithm that returns
			the node at the `beginning` of the loop.
			Definitions:
				Circular linked list is a "corrupt" linked list in which
				a nodes next pointer points to an earlier node, so as to make
				a loop in the linked list.

				O: C
			Hints:
				50, 69, 83, 90
